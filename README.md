Granted, these are quite sloppy, but they were modified over time.

## Victories and Defeats

- I ran into some trouble making the color-theme button toggle between two colors, but with lots of experimentation, I solved my by introducing a third variable to assign different values to, and now it works! Yipee!
- When it came to addressing media responsiveness, I learned how important the mobile first approach is!
